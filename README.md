# How it works
This plugin will search for all the h2(can be changed) tags with id attributes present, and make a table of contents with these header tags.

# How to use
Just include 'toc_plugin.js' into your blog/website and place &lt;div id=&quot;container-toc&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; where you want to show your table of contents. That's it.
